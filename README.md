PHP-security-classes
====================

The initial idea of this repository is to simply add some classes that makes life as a programmer a bit easier.
The reasoning for this, is that I see many many websites that have great potential, but they lack the responsibility that many web developers bare: Making their applications secure.

It's bad enough working with bad code, but working with vulverable code just makes some people (especially myself) cringe.

##What this repository is for##
This repository is **not** foolproof, and is created and maintained during my free time, feel free to contribute at any given moment or buy me a coffee <3

As I learn about certain vulnerabilities in applications, I try to write classes that fix these vulnerability in a way that is easy to understand and use for developers (even for those who don't know much about application security).

## What this repository covers##
This reposityory is currently under construction, and doesn't cover everything, but here is a list of things that have been implemented so far:

* XSS
* Downloads

## Planned classes ##
* XSRF
* Uploads

If you think I should add a file regarding a certain topic about security, let me know or add some code of your own. (Please refer to https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards for code-style guides)

Check out the wiki for more info on how to use this.
